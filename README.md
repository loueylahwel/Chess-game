♟️ Shape Shifter Chess
Because classic chess wasn’t painful enough.

Welcome to Shape Shifter Chess, where your pawns grow up to have an identity crisis instead of just picking a normal job like a queen.
Now, when a pawn promotes, it doesn't become a queen (because that would make sense).
It becomes a Shape Shifter :) a confused soul that can’t even hurt the King. 

🧠 How Shape Shifters Work
Reach the end of the board? Congrats, your pawn now has commitment issues.

Each turn, your shiny new Shape Shifter can choose to pretend it's a Rook, Knight, or Bishop.

BUT WAIT: Despite its newfound "power," the Shape Shifter cannot attack the King.
Apparently shapeshifting comes with moral obligations. Who knew?

🛠 How to Set Up (Because Pain Requires Preparation)
Set up SFML dependencies properly, or your game will collapse faster than your patience.

Fix the image paths in the project to match wherever you threw your files.

Build. Run. Regret.

⚰️ Pro Tips (That Won’t Save You)
Your Shape Shifter is a master of disguise — and still almost useless in checkmate.

Plan ahead! Or don’t. Honestly, watching the chaos unfold is half the fun.

Just remember: you can move, you can block, but the King is off-limits.
